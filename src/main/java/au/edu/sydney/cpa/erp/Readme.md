## Speical Notes for scope
1. Changes are in-scope as they are only made in feaa package excluding ReportDatabase class.
2. Changes made out of scope are mainly for testing purposes to record the RAM and time used for comparisons. They are written outside the in-scope classes temporarily for intance the CLI class, and they are not meant to be permanent and should be commented out or deleted afterwards.
3. The source code maintain a green status to pass all tests in AllowedScopeTest class.
