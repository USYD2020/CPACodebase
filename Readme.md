# Read Me

## ðŸ™‰ Fixed issues in this update
* Issue: System may lag when loading many clients
*     use lazy initialisation in ClientImpl class to mitigate lag.

* Issue: Handing client contact methods is messy
*     use Chain of Responsibility to make the handling of contact order explicit. Get rid of switch to make the code more extensible.

* Issue: Report class stored too much data and used too much RAM.
*     use Flyweight pattern to reduce use only half the RAM by addressing StackOVerFlow due to some array.clone() methods in the ReportDatabase.

* Issue: Too much Order classes.
*     Use Bridge pattern to favor composition over inheritance to reduce class load.

* Issue: Complex comparison process of Report objects
*     Override equals(Object o) to compare ReportImpl

* Issue: Slow database operations in Order creation
*     Simplify the process, use UOW to simulate a fast database and commit at logout.

## ðŸ™‰ Issues to be fixed

* Issue: Single threading is not useful.
*    Use Thread Pool to enable saving in database processes and other functions. Due to time limit and work load from other units, this issue is not sovled yet. Given more time, the student should research more and refer to week 10 homework to close this issue.

## Speical Notes for scope
1. Changes are in-scope as they are only made in feaa package excluding ReportDatabase class.
2. Changes made out of scope are mainly for testing purposes to record the RAM and time used for comparisons. They are written outside the in-scope classes temporarily for intance the CLI class, and they are not meant to be permanent and should be commented out or deleted afterwards.
3. The source code maintain a green status to pass all tests in AllowedScopeTest class.
